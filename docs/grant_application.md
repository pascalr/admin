### Introduction

**16s: Introduction du problème**

**Intro (1) - 4s** _Voir un clip d'une usine de transformation alimentaire avec beaucoup de cheminée (https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-view-of-industrial-area-5462676/)_

Food accounts for over a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.

**Intro (2) - 4s** _https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/fruits-and-vegetables-gm466696262-59862998?utm_source=pixabay&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=SRP_image_sponsored&referrer_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpixabay.com%2Fimages%2Fsearch%2Ffruits%2520packaging%2F&utm_term=fruits%20packaging_

Packaging generates a lot of plastic waste.

A lot of food is wasted.



By reducing transportation and buying locally. By avoiding food waste which takes all the energy it took to produce it and throws it all away. And finally by choosing to eat ingredients that are more environmentally friendly.

https://www.pexels.com/video/a-baker-mashing-a-dough-using-his-hands-3209831/

But how can we do all this? How to eat in an environmentally friendly-way? A simple solution is to cook by yourself from good, raw ingredients. But it takes a lot of time to cook properly every day.

### Solution armoire

**16s - Videos of what it can do**

This is why we invented Heda, the pantry robot, to assist you in everyday cookings tasks. It can store, retrieve, stir, soak, filter, sieve, blend and more.

**4s - HEDA** _Clip de l'armoire fermée avec marqué par dessus Heda - Pantry Robot, les portes s'ouvrent tranquillement._

It lives in a cupboard which can store up to 90 kg of food.

**4s - Filling containers** _Clip de d'une main en train de remplir un contenant de vitre_

The food is stored in glass containers which can be filled in bulk without packaging.

**4s - Advantage - We see easily**

The glass containers helps you see what and how much you have really easily.

**8s - Advantage - Access the inventory from anywhere** (We see someone at the grocery store looking at it's inventory to see if it needs to buy some more)

You are in the grocery store and don't remember if you have any sugar left? No worries. The robot keeps the inventory and you can access it from anywhere, anytime.

**8s - Advantage - Grocery list** _On voit le UI avec une liste d'épicerie générée automatiquement_

It keeps an eye out for low items and generates a grocery list automatically.

### Solution cooking

**12s - (4s On voit le site internet, la sélection d'une recette, on voit quelqu'un appuyé sur le bouton Fetch dans le UI, 3s on voit les pots qui sont tous dans l'ordre sur la tablette d'accès, 5s on voit quelqu'un qui cuisine à l'oeil)**

Heda's robotic arm has a lot of potential to help you cook. It can fetch all the ingredients required to do a recipe and let you add as much as you are inspired.

**8s - (on le voit en train de verser des quantités d'épices, on voit ensuite quelqu'un qui rajoute le mélange d'épices dans le plat)**
It can do some mixes. For example, some spice mixes for a recipe.

**8s - (on le voit en train de brasser de la pâte à crêpe, on voit ensuite quelqu'un en train de cuisiner des crêpes)**
It can do many batter. For example pancake or cake batter. You give it milk and eggs, and it we make all the batter by itself.

**4s - On le voit en train de faire du lait**
You don't have any milk for your recipe? No worries. It can make some vegetable milk by itself. Just the right amount needed or more to drink.

**6s - On voit la tablette pleine de pots. On voit le robot ranger un pot. On voit la tablette vide.**

And when you're done cooking, you put it back on the shelf and it stores everything.

### Solution site internet
**8s - Voir la page d'acceuil, la souris qui se déplaces sur recettes, voir la liste de recettes qui déroulent, puis la sélection d'une recette**
I am currently working on a website to host all the recipes that Heda can help you cook. The main focus are eco-friendly recipes. The website is only in french for now.
**4s - On voit quelqu'un se créer un compte**
You must login into your own account in order to fully use the website's functionallities.
Then, you can keep a list of your recipes.
You can browse by categories and by recipe name in order to find a recipe quickly. You can also browse by images in order to have an inspiration for what you want to eat.
**8s - Voir le calendrier**
You can add recipes to your calendar so Heda will prepare in advance what's needed for the recipe. The grocery list will also be updated automatically.
**8s - Voir les ingrédients directement dans les instructions**
One innovation is to add the ingrdients quantity directly into the instructions. This way it is easier to follow the recipe. You don't have to go back and forth between instructions and ingredients.
**8s - On voit quelqu'un modifier une recette.**
You can modify recipes to your liking.
**Voir l'inventaire de l'appareil sur le site**

### More about environmental impact of Heda

Go back to each point in the introduction and say how Heda helps to contribute.

Many pantry items have a big advantage. They are environmentally friendly compared to others. For example, beans and flours are a great source of calories and proteins. Instead of thinking meat-first, thinking pantry first is a great way to help the environment.

### More about the robot

**4s - On voit le système de contrepoids**

The robot is built with a counter-weight in order to be energy efficient. Only small motors are used to run the whole machine.

C'est combien l'énergie utilisé par la machine pour une recette?

? It is a negligeable amount compared to the amount required for cooking. ?

The robot is still a prototype. Many parts are 3d-printed and will be replaced by proper parts in due time.

The robot is built with repearability in mind. It is meant to last a very long time. Wears parts, like bearings and bushings, are easily accessible and replaceable. Videos will be avaible online to show you how to maintain your machine.

### Open-source

All the code will be open-source to give much freedom and control.

Potential to be voice-activated. Heda, make me a bread.

Potential to communicate with other smart devices, for example a smart fridge in order to get a full grocery list.

The plans this cupboard are available online. This cuboard is made mainly out of hardwood so it lasts a long time.

Everything will be freely available so people can build their own themselves if they want to.

### Current state

The robot is currently still a prototype. There is much work left to be done.

### Business model

Explain about the business model. I want to sell kits that people can buy and assemble themselves.

## 1) Tell us about the world as you see it.
(A description of the status quo and context in which you will be working)

I come from Québec, the french part of Canada. I am lucky to have been raised well by a modest, but loving family on a farm. I am a self-taught multi-disciplinary person. I love technology and what it enables us to do. Give me a computer with an internet connection and I feel there is nothing I can't do.

I am also an optimist. When I watch science-fiction movies set in the future, I don't understand why they are all so bleak. Personally, I have high hopes for the future of humanity. But we have to survive the next centuries to keep evolving and make our civilisation stand the test of time.

One of the greatest treats to humanity is the environment. The most obvious issue being the climate change. There is a lot of room for improvements. Currently, I am especially focusing on the food aspect. I am concerned about transportation, trash, waste and the type of food.

Transportation is frequently inneficient for food[1]. Raw food is transported accross the world to be transformed in another country where there is more technology or cheap labor. Then the transformed product travels again accross the world to reach the supermarket shelves.[2]

Energy is also wasted on single-use packaging. Not only does it waste energy to package, it accumules trash. Worst of all, it is not always properly disposed of and is often found polluting the environment.

There is also a lot food waste. This is really bad because it takes all the energy it took to produce, transform, package and transport the food and throws it all away for nothing.

One of the main environmental factor is the type of food.[3] Some types are really more environmentally friendly than others. For example, plant based diets are usually much earthy frienlier than meat based diets. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of time to cook vegetarian. For example, to cook vegetarian, you often have to cook the meat substitute, than you can cook your recipe as usual. You cook vegan sausages with seitan, caramelized onions and other ingredients, then you can eat your stew with sausages inside.

There are some solutions already that aims to fix thoses issues, but none are ideal.

There is slowly starting to have more and more choice of transformed meat substitute. So this can save time, but it does not solve the other issues. Also, they are usually expensive. They should be cheap because the raw ingredients are cheap.

Ready-to-cook boxes aim at lowering food waste by giving you just enough and no more to make a recipe. It may help for food waste, but it usually adds transportation to deliver the boxes. Also, they are usually terrible with packaging. They package every item separately in single-use plastics. Plus, it is not cheap. This is environmentally important because if you took all the money you saved and paid for carbon sequestration instead, you would make a much better impact.

Some restaurants are environmentally conscious. So this can be a good solution for people who have the means. But again, this is expensive. Also, eating at home gives more freedom because you can eat exactly what you want, the way you want it.

Since the beginning of Covid 19, I have been trying to tackle these issues with a project of mine that I working full time on.

## 2) What change do you want to make in the world?
(A description of what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision for this area)

I want a world where you go at a local market and buy products without any packaging. You bring those raw ingredients from the field and transform them at home into delicious meals.

I want people to buy food in bulk without packaging and I want people to eat more earth-friendly food. I plan to achieve this by making the process easier.

For the past year and a half, I have been working on an invention of mine: a pantry robot. The idea is to have a cupboard with containers to store dry ingredients combined with a robotic arm which handles the inventory and also helps with cooking.

The robot would keep an eye out for the inventory and generate a grocery list automatically. No more need to worry about missing something. You can even access your inventory from anywhere, anytime, to reassure yourself.

In a smart fridge, they use cameras and scales to handle the inventory. The advantage of using a robotic arm instead, is that it has to potential to do so much more. You can select a recipe and the robot will bring out the required ingredients. It can store everything when you're finished. It can do mixes.

I plan to integrate a water intake to be able to clean and soak ingredients. I also want to incorporate a hand mixer, a spatula and a dough hook. This would allow the robot to do complex recipes like bread dough, bean salads, cake batter, etc.

In the best of worlds, the machine would also include a tiny dishwasher that self-cleans the containers and the tools it uses.

A great advantage of cooking with pantry ingredients is that they are generally very environmentally-friendly like beans, grains and flours. Another plus, is that it is very economical. I am always designed my product with price in mind. I want my product to be an investment that saves you money in the long run by cooking cheap basic ingredients.

I want to make it more easy to eat vegetarian than to eat meat. For example, you need ground beef to make hamburgers which has a low shelf life, of then it is frozen and you have to thing in advance to unfreeze it. With vegetarian burgers and my product, you always can eat hambugers. Just press one button the morning or the night before, and the robot will soak, and cook the beans et prepare the whole burger mixture. The only thing left will be to shape and cook the burgers.

More easy to eat vegetarian also by giving open access to a lot of vegetarian recipes.

I want people to eat more earth-friendly food.

My solution to eating more environmentally-friendly food at home is 

The first issue I want to tackle is to reduce the amount of single-use food packaging. A simple solution is to bring your own containers and to fill them with food bought in bulk.

This is great for primary ingredients, but it does not work so well with transformed, perishable food. The solution is then to transform and cook food youself at home. But this takes a lot of time.

For example, instead of buying bread in a plastic bag, you flour, sugar, salt 

But this takes a lot of time.

I want people to buy food in bulk without packaging.

I want to make home-cooking earth-friendly cheap and easy.

I would like people to eat more earth-friendly food. I want to achieve that by convincing their wallet and their lazyness.

For example, I want more people to eat vegetarian burgers which are a lot more environment-friendly and much cheaper too. But it is easier to cook meat burgers. With beans, you have plan and not forget the night to soak them, cook them, prepare the mixture and then you have to cook the burgers.

Another reason some people prefer to eat meat burgers is taste. But I believe this is more about habits. My favourite meal used to be beef hamburgers, but now I like vegetarian hamburgers just as muched.

One of the main issue with cooking earth-friendly food is the lack of time.

I have been working for the past year and a half on a pantry robot.

Another great advance is that this way you eat more fresh! Instead of buying a big bread every couple of days, you can cook a small bread every day.

To summarize, I want people to be able to eat earth-friendly food easily and to reduce the amount of food packaging by cooking with a pantry robot.

## 3) What do you believe has prevented this change to date?
(Describe the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year)

I see two main reasons this change was not yet made: the technology is recent and the technology is expensive.

If you look at competitors like Molley Robotics, you see it is a hard field.

**Important!!!**
## 4) What are you going to do to get there?
(A description of what you actually plan to do during the year)

I want keep working on this full-time.

Receiving this grant would allow me to keep working full-time and it would allow to hire someone to work with me.

**Important!!!**
## 5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

Challenge 1: Being able to sell my product. My product is similar to smart fridges. Their goal being to be more environmental friendly by avoiding food waste. But the first smart fridges did not sell well, consumers thought it was overpriced for the benefit. I took time to develop a cheaper product that finaly users were interested in buying.

## 6) What part does openness play in your idea?

Openness is one of my core values. I've always used open software almost exclusively (Linux/Godot/Freecad/OpenShot/Krita and so much more) and the least I can do is contribute back.

Being an electromechanic, I am used to repair all sorts of things and I understand how frustrating it is when you can't find schematics or spare parts for something you bought. I want my project to not only be open-source, but to be open-hardware.

I don't want to buy a smart TV. I hate the fact you have don't have control of something you own and bought in your own house.





## -----------------------

I want the robotic arm .

I learn about your grant through FarmBot on the series A article. I though it was really cool of them to be open about the way the company evolved and their status. I would like to do the same.

The world is very simple, yet very complex at the same time. Grown-ups are still a lot like little children.

I did not know what I wanted to do. I wrote 3 words on my board for a while until my idea came to me.


Environment. Food. Automation.

Environment because I believe this is of the greatest treat that humanity is currently facing.
Food. Because food is a basic human need. Working in the food area makes me feel like what I am doing is worth it.
Automation. This is my domain of expertise. To solve the environement, we could either go backwards and avoid technology and energy,
or we can go forward. I don't believe we are ever going to go backwards, so I believe in automation to solve the environment issue.

# Deprecated

There is a lot of room for improvements for reducing that number. By avoiding packaging which takes a lot of ressources to produce. By reducing transportation and buying locally. By avoiding food waste which takes all the energy it took to produce it and throws it all away. And finally by choosing to eat ingredients that are more environmentally friendly.

**Mission - 4s (We want to make it easier to eat in a earth-friendly way.)**

We can do better. We should be able to enjoy eating food in a earth-friendly way.

**8s hard to have enough time to eat** 

One solution is simple. Cook by yourself from good, raw ingredients. But it takes a lot of time to cook properly every day.

**4s - On voit une machine en train de pétrir la pâte, on voit un bon pain en train d'être sortit du four**
A future option will even knead dough. So you can eat so fresh bread every day.

The advantage of having a robotic arm is that is has a lot of potential to help you with cooking. It can fetch and measure all the ingredients you need for a recipe so you can cook like a pro chef.

_On voit les pots avec tous les ingrédients et toi qui ne reste plus qu'à verser les ingrédients dans le bol de cuisson_

**EST-CE QUE C'EST PRATIQUE DE VERSER DE LA FARINE DANS UN BOL???**

The main focus are recipes that are environmentally-friendly, but others are included for completeness sake.
