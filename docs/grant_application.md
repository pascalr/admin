## Introduction

Over a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions is emitted because of food. Sources like transportation, packaging, heavy carbon-footprint diets and food waste could all be improved. A simple solution is to cook by yourself from good, raw ingredients. But it takes a lot of time to cook properly every day. We want to help. (((((We want to make eating good food at home in an environmentally-friendly way easy.)))))

## Solution armoire

This is why we invented Heda, the pantry robot, to assist you in everyday cookings tasks. It can store, retrieve, stir, soak, filter, sieve, blend and more. It lives in a cupboard which can store up to 90 kg of food. The food is stored in glass containers which can be filled in bulk without packaging. The glass containers helps you see what and how much you have really easily. You are in the grocery store and don't remember if you have any sugar left? No worries. The robot keeps the inventory and you can access it from anywhere, anytime. It keeps an eye out for low items and generates a grocery list automatically.

### Solution cooking

Heda's robotic arm has a lot of potential to help you cook. It can fetch all the ingredients needed for a recipe and let you add as much as you are inspired. It can do some mixes. For example, it can mix some spices together. It can do many types of batter like pancake or cake batter. You give it milk and eggs, and it we make all the batter by itself. You don't have any milk for your pancakes? No worries. It can make some vegetable milk by itself. Just the right amount needed or more to drink. And when you're done cooking, you put the containers back on the shelf and it stores everything.

### Solution site internet
**8s - Voir la page d'acceuil, la souris qui se déplaces sur recettes, voir la liste de recettes qui déroulent, puis la sélection d'une recette**
I am currently working on a website to host all the recipes that Heda can help you cook. The main focus are eco-friendly recipes. The website is only in french for now.
**4s - On voit quelqu'un se créer un compte**
You must login into your own account in order to fully use the website's functionallities.
Then, you can keep a list of your recipes.
You can browse by categories and by recipe name in order to find a recipe quickly. You can also browse by images in order to have an inspiration for what you want to eat.
**8s - Voir le calendrier**
You can add recipes to your calendar so Heda will prepare in advance what's needed for the recipe. The grocery list will also be updated automatically.
**8s - Voir les ingrédients directement dans les instructions**
One innovation is to add the ingrdients quantity directly into the instructions. This way it is easier to follow the recipe. You don't have to go back and forth between instructions and ingredients.
**8s - On voit quelqu'un modifier une recette.**
You can modify recipes to your liking.

### More about environmental impact of Heda

Go back to each point in the introduction and say how Heda helps to contribute.

Many pantry items have a big advantage. They are environmentally friendly compared to others. For example, beans and flours are a great source of calories and proteins. Instead of thinking meat-first, thinking pantry first is a great way to help the environment.

### More about the robot

**4s - On voit le système de contrepoids**

The robot is built with a counter-weight in order to be energy efficient. Only small motors are used to run the whole machine.

C'est combien l'énergie utilisé par la machine pour une recette?

? It is a negligeable amount compared to the amount required for cooking. ?

The robot is still a prototype. Many parts are 3d-printed and will be replaced by proper parts in due time.

The robot is built with repearability in mind. It is meant to last a very long time. Wears parts, like bearings and bushings, are easily accessible and replaceable. Videos will be avaible online to show you how to maintain your machine.

### Open-source

All the code will be open-source to give much freedom and control.

Potential to be voice-activated. Heda, make me a bread.

Potential to communicate with other smart devices, for example a smart fridge in order to get a full grocery list.

The plans this cupboard are available online. This cuboard is made mainly out of hardwood so it lasts a long time.

Everything will be freely available so people can build their own themselves if they want to.

### Current state

The robot is currently still a prototype. There is much work left to be done.

### Business model

Explain about the business model. I want to sell kits that people can buy and assemble themselves.

## 1) Tell us about the world as you see it.
(A description of the status quo and context in which you will be working)

I come from Québec, the french part of Canada. I am a self-taught multi-disciplinary person who loves technology.

I am also an optimist. When I watch science-fiction movies set in the future, I don't understand why they are all so bleak. Personally, I have high hopes for the future of humanity. But we have to survive the next centuries to keep evolving and make our civilisation stand the test of time.

One of the greatest treats to humanity is the environment. The most obvious issue being the climate change. There is a lot of room for improvements. Currently, I am working toward improving the environmental aspect of food. I am concerned about transportation, trash, waste and diets.

Needless to say transportation emits greenhouse gas emissions. We could reduce them by avoiding transporting long distances to transformation factories. Raw food is frequently transported far away to be transformed or packaged. Then the final product travels again far away to reach the end customer.

Energy is also wasted on single-use packaging. Not only does it waste energy to package, it accumules trash. Worst of all, it is not always properly disposed of and is often found polluting the environment.

There is also the issue of food waste. Roughly a third of the food produced for human consumption is wasted every year[1]. It is especially bad because it takes all the energy it took to produce, transform, package and transport the food and throws it all away for nothing.

Last but not least, not all types of food have the same environment impact. Some types require a lot more ressources to produce. For example, meat based diets usually have a much higher carbon footprint than plant based diets.[2]

There already exists some solutions that aims to fix thoses issues, but none are ideal.

There is slowly more and more choices of transformed meat substitutes. This helps to eat low carbon footprint meals by saving time cooking, but it does not solve the other issues of transportation, packaging and food waste.

Ready-to-cook boxes aim at lowering food waste by giving you just enough and not too much to make a recipe. It may help for food waste, but it usually adds transportation to deliver the boxes. Also, they are usually terrible with packaging. They package every item separately in single-use plastics.

Some restaurants are environmentally conscious. So this can be a good solution for people who have the means. But it gets expensive quickly. Also, eating at home gives more freedom because you can eat exactly what you want, the way you want it.

Since the beginning of Covid 19, I have been trying to tackle these issues with a project of mine that I working full time on.

**Important!!!**
## 2) What change do you want to make in the world?
(A description of what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision for this area)

I want a world where you go at a local market and buy products without any packaging. You bring those raw ingredients from the field and transform them at home into delicious meals.

Concretely, I want people to buy food in bulk without packaging, to eat more earth-friendly food and to cook more meals at home. I plan to achieve this by making the process easier.

For the past year and a half, I have been working on an invention of mine: a pantry robot. The idea is to have a cupboard with containers to store dry ingredients combined with a robotic arm which handles the inventory and also helps with cooking.

The robot would keep an eye out for the inventory and generate a grocery list automatically. It tells you how much to buy of everything based on your habits and your meals planned in your calendar. It tells you which container size to use and how much to fill it. Also, you can even access your inventory from anywhere, anytime, to check how much of something you have remaining.

In a smart fridge, they use cameras and scales to handle the inventory. The advantage of using a robotic arm instead, is that it has to potential to do so much more. You can select a recipe and the robot will bring out the required ingredients. It can store everything when you're finished. It can also mix ingredients together.

I plan to integrate a water intake to be able to clean and soak ingredients. I also want to incorporate a hand mixer, a spatula and a dough hook. This would allow the robot to do complex recipes like bread dough, bean salads, cake batter, etc.

In the best of worlds, the machine would also include a tiny dishwasher that let the robot clean the containers and the tools it uses.

I want users to be able to access their recipes from anywhere, so there needs to be a website to host the data. I would also like the website to already include plenty of recipes the machine can help you cook. The main focus would be eco-friendly recipes.

A great advantage of cooking with pantry ingredients is that they are generally very environmentally-friendly. They have a long shelf life so it is easy to avoid food waste. They are usually plant-based and have a low carbon footprint like beans and grains. They also have the benefit to be very economical. I am always designing my product with price in mind. I want my product to be an investment that saves you money in the long run by cooking cheap basic ingredients.

I want to make it more easy to eat vegetarian than to eat meat. For example, to make hamburgers, you need ground beef which has a low shelf life. You can freeze it, but then you have to think in advance to unfreeze it. With vegetarian burgers and my product, you can always eat hambugers. Just add "chickpea burgers" to your calendar, and the robot will soak and cook the beans. It will prepare the whole burger mixture by mixing with seasonings. The only thing left will be to shape and cook the burgers.

To summarize, I want people to be able to eat earth-friendly food easily and to reduce the amount of food waste and packaging by helping cooking with pantry ingredients filled in bulk.

**Important!!!**
## 3) What do you believe has prevented this change to date?
(Describe the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year)

People are not eating in an environmentally-friendly way mainly because it is easier not to. It's easy to buy food in cardboard and plastic at the grocery store. It's easy to cook meals with meat because they usually taste good without much effort.

The annoyances of bulk stores is that you can't just go there. You can't just stop by after work on your way home. You have to plan in advance in order to bring your containers. My machine would help by taking the worry of planning away. It would handle the inventory automatically and give you reminders when you need to go grocery shopping.

Right now, meat based food is subjectively tastier than plant based food without much effort. But I believe this will change soon. I believe there will be a meat substitute with similar or even better taste. But, this is far from my competences.

What I can do though, is make a website to create and archive delicious eco-friendly recipes. I want users of my machine to already have plenty of choices of recipes as soon as they receive it. Furthermore, I want the recipes to be freely available to everyone, even to people who did not bought the machine. At the same time, it could serve as marketing.

I would like to give users the possibility to share their recipes with the world. They could either keep them private locally, keep them private on our server for a small price or make them public. We could analyze the public data to create user suggestions, rank recipes and to share with other users.

I believe a pantry robot does not exists yet because the technology is relatively new and it is costly to develop. Robotics can get expensive really quickly. One of my competitor is Moley Robotics. They offer a robot that cooks at a price of $335,000 USD.[1] This is not what I want to make. I want to make an affordable robot for every household. Obviously it will be able to execute much less actions, but by focusing mostly on pantry recipes, it can be enough.

The first model I plan to release will be targeted at high-end customers and early adopters. Over time, I should be able to save costs by producing larger quantities. I want to do the same thing than for 3d printers. They were quite expensive at the beginning, but now they can be a common household item.

**Important!!!**
## 4) What are you going to do to get there?
(A description of what you actually plan to do during the year)

There is still a lot that needs to be done. On the product side, I need to keep working on the recipe website, the cupboard, a robotic simulation and the actual robot. On the business side, I need to incorporate and grow the company.

I am working on a recipe website to host the user's recipes. I am slowly building a libray of recipes for marketing and in order to have a list to give users who buy the machine. I want to use the website as a way to attract customers. You see a recipe and it tells you how much time you would save if you bought our machine. The website could also be product of his own and a way to generate revenue.

The cupboard is well developped. I would like to start selling some. It can be used well without the robotic arm inside. The customer will be able to purchase and install the robotic arm latter. I don't think this will be a big part of revenue because it is bulky and hard to ship. The design is open and I encourage people to make their own. I want to make a detailed webpage and a video that teach people how.

A robotic simulation is required in order to develop the robotic arm. The simulation helps to determine what is actually feasible. The product will live in a home kitchen so it has strict requirements. It must be compact, quiet, safe, pretty and functional. Once we know what can be done, the simulation is very helpful to help achieve it. For example, it helps to visualize the inventory from the robots perspective and it helps with motion planning. The simulation is already well developped, so there is not a lot of work required for this specifically.

The actual robot is where there is the most work left to be done. The current robotic arm is still a prototype.

I am satisfied with the mechanical design which is now stiff and strong enough. I am slowly replacing 3d printed parts with proper parts.

The electrical design needs much work. It is already fully functional, but it is not pretty nor safe. There needs to be a proper enclosure, components and wiring. Someone with proper experience will need to be hired for this or an engineering firm will need to be consulted.

There is much programming left to do to program the robotic arm. I've started doing motion planning and collision detection, but more work is required.

Also, I would like to spend time to work with the robot's camera, a sink and tools like spoons and blenders. I've worked on some of this, but the design changed quite a bit since then so I have to start from scratch.

On the business side, the company is not yet incorporated. I am waiting as long as possible to avoid unnecessary costs.

This project is currently a one person job. If I get this grant, one thing I would love to do is to hire someone to work with me. I am a technical founder and I like to do technical stuff. I would like to hire someone to take care of all the business side.

For the company, I aim to model what FarmBot[1] is doing. It's a company that your organisation supported in 2014. I want to spend some time developping the product, then launch a crowdfunding campaign. It is usefull for gaining visibility, sales and financing in order to manufacture. Like them, I aim to provide open-source hardware and software and sell kits to assemble.

I have the ambition of growing the company. I would like to pursue further funding and hire employees. This way we develop the product quicker and we profit more from being first to market. Some companies in the same area are huge and have a lot of ressources to compete. For example, Samsung is spending a lot in research and development in the connected kitchen. Being first to market gives me a competitive edge, but I have to be big enough then.

[1] https://farm.bot/

**Important!!!**
## 5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

The kitchen robotics space is very new and as such, the market is not well validated. I did a survey and got positive results, but I am still worried that the market is too small.

One challenge will be to actually sell my product. The product is similar to smart fridges. The first smart fridges did not sell well, consumers thought it was overpriced for the benefit. It took time to develop a cheaper product that finaly users were interested in buying.

One major concern of mine is safety. A key feature of the machine would be it's independence. It would be awesome if the robot could start cooking by itself when you are at work, then you come home and finish what it started. But in order for the machine to work without supervision, the technology must be well advanced. I don't want to be responsible for fires or property damage.

There are plenty of technical challenges. I did a proof of concept about most aspects already and I can make it work sometimes. But the challenge is to make it work all the time. For example, with little work, I was able to detect jars most of the time, but this is not enough. It needs to be able to detect jars 100% of the time. Otherwise the robotic arm will probably break it if it does not know it is there.

## 6) What part does openness play in your idea?

Openness is really important for me because it resonates with two of my core values: freedom and transparency. It takes place in many aspects of my idea. My project will be open-source and open-hardware and the company will be open.

My whole life, I've been using open software almost exclusively. I am using Linux, Firefox, Godot, Freecad, LibreOffice, Bootstrap, Ruby on rails, Gimp, Blender, OpenShot, Krita and so much more. So the least I can do is contribute back and make my software open source. Users will be able to tweak and play with the robotic arm. They will be able to modify the application to customize it to their liking.

I am wondering whether I want to release my project under GPL or MIT license. GPL reassures me by feeling more secure about preventing my idea to be stollen, but I am not the biggest fan of the license. The theory and the idea is good, but in practice I don't like it. It does not give full freedom. When I look for some code on the internet, I love it when it is released under MIT license.

Before working on my project, I was working as an electromechanic. So I am used to repair all sorts of things and I understand how frustrating it is when you can't find schematics or spare parts for something you bought. I want my project to not only be open-source, but to be open-hardware. I want to make schematics and part lists available so people will always be able to repair their machine.

I not only want the product to be open, I want the company to be open too.

I want my company to freely share the salary of each employee. I understand why companies hide this data. It allows to underpay employees because they can't complain if they don't know they are making less than their peers. Also, it can avoid some jaleousy. But I think people eventually find out anyway and it makes them not only jaleous but frustated. I much prefer to be open and upfront. Every position in the company would have a set salary. This brings it's set of issues, but it is a must in my book.

I learnt about your grant through FarmBot on their series A article[1]. I though it was really cool of them to be open about the way the company evolved and their status. They even shared sales, capitalization and their business plan. I would like to do the same.

I believe openness is important in order to have control. Personally, I don't want to buy a smart TV unless it would be open. I hate the fact that you don't have control of something you own and bought in your own house.

[1] https://farm.bot/pages/series-a

## -----------------------

I want the robotic arm .

I did not know what I wanted to do. I wrote 3 words on my board for a while until my idea came to me.


Environment. Food. Automation.

Environment because I believe this is of the greatest treat that humanity is currently facing.
Food. Because food is a basic human need. Working in the food area makes me feel like what I am doing is worth it.
Automation. This is my domain of expertise. To solve the environement, we could either go backwards and avoid technology and energy,
or we can go forward. I don't believe we are ever going to go backwards, so I believe in automation to solve the environment issue.

# Deprecated

I want the website to be a product of his own. This is a highly competitive space. There are already thousands of recipe websites online. The website I want to be partially open. The data that users enter will be freely available for them. They will always be able to download their recipes. I don't want to release the website's source code though because I don't see any use. Users will be able to download their own recipes and any public recipes.

Another aspect of openness is accessibility. 

I followed a cursus to learn how to make a company. I started doing a business plan, but my idea has eveloved over time. I will have to 

Another reason this does not exist yet is that the technology is relatively recent. It takes time do develop an affordable solution. It took time for smart fridge to become a real product. At first, people tought it was useless for the price. But slowly the companies were able to lower the price and people started to see the usefullness.

Home robotics is an area which is constantly increasing. The robotic flour cleaner and grass mower being the two most successful examples for now.

I would like the explore the idea of open cooking. Recipes are generally open because recipe steps and ingredients are not copyrightable. Only the expression of the recipe is copyrightable. Only the texts, pictures and videos are protected.

I would like to give users the possibility to share their recipes with the world. Public recipes would be freely available to everyone.

Weirdly, by being open I could not find a good source of open recipes. You can scrap website to get some, but it can be frown-upon or even illegal based on their terms of service.0

I would like to allow the users to 

I would like to explore what I want to do with the website. A user sharing platform? A tool for recipe creators? 
Well I need to make a website anyway to host the recipes of the machines. I also want the website to be connected to the machine.
I want a website where I can put my own recipes. Also, I want a lot of features like the ability to scale the quantities. One innovation of mine is to add the ingredient quantities directly into the instructions, so you don't have to go back and forth.
I don't yet know exactly what I want to do with users on the website. 
I would like to make the website available as a tool for other food creators as well.
The website will also be used for marketing.
I want to make a website to create and archive delicious eco-friendly recipes and I want to build my pantry robot to help with cooking.


There has been a lot of improvements over the year for vegetarian food. I predict that in a near future, most people will be vegetarian for all sorts of reasons like ethics, environmental, health, money or taste. Right now, sadly, meat based food is usualy much tastier than plant based food without much effort. But I believe this will change soon. I believe there will be a meat substitute with similar or even better taste. But, this is not my fight though. This is far away from my competences.

But I think people are getting more environmentally conscious and are slowly changing their habits. The zero waste movement is catching on. I see more and more bulk stores that aim to be zero waste.

The change is actually slowly taking place. There is a lot more bulk grocery stores than before[CITATION NEEDED]. People are moving toward ecologic diets.[CITATION NEEDED] They are getting more conscious about where the food is coming from. But I want to accelerate theses changes even more. This is why I am working hard to find solutions so eating in an environmentally conscious way is as painless as possible.

[1] https://ici.radio-canada.ca/mordu/2894/voyage-poires-publication-virale-mondialisation

 Unfortunately, it takes a lot of time to cook vegetarian and it is not to everyone's taste.

Needless to say transportation emits greenhouse gas emissions. We could reduce them by avoiding transportation to transformation factories far away. Raw food is frequently transported accross the world to be transformed in another country where there is more technology or cheap labor. Then the transformed product travels again accross the world to reach the end customer.[1]

I love technology and what it enables us to do. Give me a computer with an internet connection and I feel like there is nothing I can't do.

 This is environmentally important because if you took all the money you saved and paid for carbon sequestration instead, you would make a much better impact. [CITATION NEEDED]
 
  Also, they are usually expensive. They should be cheap because the raw ingredients are cheap.

It is easy for fast-food restaurants to give food in throwable containers instead of doing the dishes. 

For example, to cook vegetarian, you often have to cook the meat substitute, than you can cook your recipe as usual. You cook vegan sausages with seitan, caramelized onions and other ingredients, then you can eat your stew with sausages inside.

I am lucky to have been raised well by a modest, but loving family on a farm.

no more need to worry about missing something

The first issue I want to tackle is to reduce the amount of single-use food packaging. A simple solution is to bring your own containers and to fill them with food bought in bulk.

This is great for primary ingredients, but it does not work so well with transformed, perishable food. The solution is then to transform and cook food youself at home. But this takes a lot of time.

I would like people to eat more earth-friendly food. I want to achieve that by convincing their wallet and their lazyness.

Another reason some people prefer to eat meat burgers is taste. But I believe this is more about habits. My favourite meal used to be beef hamburgers, but now I like vegetarian hamburgers just as muched.

Another great advance is that this way you eat more fresh! Instead of buying a big bread every couple of days, you can cook a small bread every day.

There is a lot of room for improvements for reducing that number. By avoiding packaging which takes a lot of ressources to produce. By reducing transportation and buying locally. By avoiding food waste which takes all the energy it took to produce it and throws it all away. And finally by choosing to eat ingredients that are more environmentally friendly.

To be honest though, the idea of openness in my project scares me. For the past year and a half I have been working privately. It is scarry to think that someone ill intentioned could use what I produce and profit from it. But I guess I will only release the source code and hardware when the product is ready to be sold, so I should not be afraid that someone beats me to market first. Being first should give me enough of an advantage.

**Mission - 4s (We want to make it easier to eat in a earth-friendly way.)**

We can do better. We should be able to enjoy eating food in a earth-friendly way.

**8s hard to have enough time to eat** 

One solution is simple. Cook by yourself from good, raw ingredients. But it takes a lot of time to cook properly every day.
