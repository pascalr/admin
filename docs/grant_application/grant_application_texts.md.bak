## 1) Tell us about the world as you see it.
(A description of the status quo and context in which you will be working)

I come from Qu√©bec, the french part of Canada. I am lucky to have been raised by a modest, yet loving family. This made me an optimist. When I watch science-fiction movies set in the future, I don't understand why they are all so bleak. Personally, I have high hopes for the future of humanity. But we have to survive the next centuries to keep evolving and make our civilisation stand the test of time.

One of the greatest treats to humanity is the environment. The most obvious issue being the climate change. There is a lot of room for improvements. Currently, I am working towards improving the environmental aspect of food. I am concerned about transportation, trash, waste and diets.

Needless to say transportation emits greenhouse gas emissions. We could reduce them by avoiding transporting long distances to transformation factories. Raw food is frequently transported far away to be transformed or packaged. Then, the final product travels again far away to reach the end customer.

Energy is also wasted on single-use packaging. Not only does it waste energy to package, it accumulates trash. Worst of all, it is not always properly disposed of and is often found polluting the environment.

There is also the issue of food waste. Roughly a third of the food produced for human consumption is wasted every year[1]. It is especially bad because it takes all the energy it took to produce, transform, package and transport the food and throws it all away for nothing.

Last but not least, not all types of food have the same environment impact. Some types require a lot more resources to produce. For example, meat based diets usually have a much higher carbon footprint than plant based diets.[2]

There already exists some solutions that aims to fix those issues, but none are ideal.

There is slowly more and more choices of transformed meat substitutes. This helps to eat low carbon footprint meals by saving time cooking, but it does not solve the other issues of transportation, packaging and food waste.

Ready-to-cook boxes aim at lowering food waste by giving you just enough and not too much to make a recipe. It may help for food waste, but it usually adds transportation to deliver the boxes. Also, they are usually terrible with packaging. They package every item separately in single-use plastics.

Some restaurants are environmentally conscious. So this can be a good solution for people who have the means. But it gets expensive quickly. Also, eating at home gives more freedom because you can eat exactly what you want, the way you want it.

Since the beginning of COVID-19, I have been trying to tackle these issues with a project of mine that I working full time on.

## 2) What change do you want to make in the world?
(A description of what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision for this area)

I want a world where you go at a local market and buy products without any packaging. You bring those raw ingredients from the field and transform them at home into delicious meals.

Concretely, I want people to buy food in bulk without packaging, to eat more earth-friendly food and to cook more meals at home. I plan to achieve this by making the process easier.

For the past year and a half, I have been working on an invention of mine: a pantry robot. The idea is to have a cupboard with containers to store dry ingredients combined with a robotic arm which handles the inventory and also helps with cooking.

The robot would keep an eye out for the inventory and generate a grocery list automatically. It tells you how much to buy of everything based on your habits and your meals planned in your calendar. It tells you which container size to use and how much to fill it. Also, you can even access your inventory from anywhere, anytime, to check how much of something you have remaining. In order to avoid food waste, the machine suggests recipes that use ingredients that are about to expire.

In a smart fridge, they use cameras and scales to handle the inventory. The advantage of using a robotic arm instead, is that it has to potential to do so much more. You can select a recipe and the robot will bring out the required ingredients. It can store everything when you're finished. It can also mix ingredients together.

I plan to integrate a water intake to be able to clean and soak ingredients. I also want to incorporate a hand mixer, a spatula and a dough hook. This would allow the robot to do complex recipes like bread dough, bean salads, cake batter, etc.

In the best of worlds, the machine would also include a tiny dishwasher that let the robot clean the containers and the tools it uses.

I want users to be able to access their recipes from anywhere, so there needs to be a website to host the data. I would also like the website to already include plenty of recipes the machine can help you cook. The main focus would be eco-friendly recipes.

A great advantage of cooking with pantry ingredients is that they are generally very environmentally-friendly. They have a long shelf life so it is easy to avoid food waste. They are usually plant-based and have a low carbon footprint like beans and grains. They also have the benefit to be very economical. I am always designing my product with price in mind. I want my product to be an investment that saves you money in the long run by cooking cheap basic ingredients.

I want to make it more easy to eat vegetarian than to eat meat. For example, to make hamburgers, you need ground beef which has a low shelf life. You can freeze it, but then you have to think in advance to unfreeze it. With vegetarian burgers and my product, you can always eat hambugers. Just add "chickpea burgers" to your calendar, and the robot will soak and cook the beans. It will prepare the whole burger mixture by mixing with seasonings. The only thing left will be to shape and cook the burgers.

To summarize, I want people to be able to eat earth-friendly food easily and to reduce the amount of food waste and packaging by helping cooking with pantry ingredients bought in bulk.

## 3) What do you believe has prevented this change to date?
(Describe the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year)

People are not eating in an environmentally-friendly way mainly because it is easier not to. It's easy to buy food in cardboard and plastic at the grocery store. It's easy to cook meals with meat because they usually taste good without much effort.

The annoyances of bulk stores is that you can't just go there. You can't just stop by after work on your way home. You have to plan in advance in order to bring your containers. My machine would help by taking the worry of planning away. It would handle the inventory automatically and give you reminders when you need to go grocery shopping.

Right now, meat based food is subjectively tastier than plant based food without much effort. But I believe this will change soon. I believe there will be a meat substitute with similar or even better taste. But, this is far from my competences.

What I can do though, is make a website to create and archive delicious eco-friendly recipes. I want users of my machine to already have plenty of choices of recipes as soon as they receive it. Furthermore, I want the recipes to be freely available to everyone, even to people who did not bought the machine. At the same time, it could serve as marketing.

I would like to give users the possibility to share their recipes with the world. They could either keep them private locally, keep them private on our server for a small price or make them public. We could analyze the public data to create user suggestions, rank recipes and to share with other users.

I believe a pantry robot does not exists yet because the technology is relatively new and it is costly to develop. Robotics can get expensive really quickly. One of my competitor is Moley Robotics. They offer a robot that cooks at a price of $335,000 USD.[1] This is not what I want to make. I want to make an affordable robot for every household. Obviously it will be able to execute much less actions, but by focusing mostly on pantry recipes, it can be enough.

The first model I plan to release will be targeted at high-end customers and early adopters. Over time, I should be able to save costs by producing larger quantities. I want to do the same thing than for 3d printers. They were quite expensive at the beginning, but now they can be a common household item.

## 4) What are you going to do to get there?
(A description of what you actually plan to do during the year)

There is still a lot that needs to be done. On the product side, I need to keep working on the recipe website, the cupboard, a robotic simulation and the actual robot. On the business side, I need to incorporate and grow the company.

I am working on a recipe website to host the user's recipes. I am slowly building a libray of recipes for marketing and in order to have a list to give users who buy the machine. I want to use the website as a way to attract customers. You see a recipe and it tells you how much time you would save if you bought our machine. The website could also be product of his own and a way to generate revenue.

The cupboard is well developped. I would like to start selling some. It can be used well without the robotic arm inside. The customer will be able to purchase and install the robotic arm latter. The design is open and I encourage people to make their own. I want to make a detailed webpage and a video that teach people how.

The actual robot is where there is the most work left to be done. The current robotic arm is still a prototype.

I am satisfied with the mechanical design which is now stiff and strong enough. I am slowly replacing 3d printed parts with proper parts.

The electrical design needs to be remade. It is already fully functional, but it is not pretty nor safe. There needs to be a proper enclosure, components and wiring. Someone with proper experience will need to be hired for this or an engineering firm will need to be consulted.

A robotic simulation is required in order to develop the robotic arm. The simulation helps to determine what is actually feasible. The product will live in a home kitchen so it has strict requirements. It must be compact, quiet, safe, pretty and functional. Once we know what can be done, the simulation is very helpful to help achieve it. For example, it helps to visualize the inventory from the robots perspective and it helps with motion planning. When a feature is ready, I can program it directly on the actual robotic arm. Right now, the simulation is able to retrieve and store jars and the robotic arm is able to move manually.

I would like to spend time to work with the robot's camera, a sink and tools like spoons and blenders. I've worked on some of this, but the design changed quite a bit since then so I have to start from scratch.

On the business side, the company is not yet incorporated. I am waiting as long as possible to avoid unnecessary costs.

This project is currently a one person job. If I get this grant, one thing I would love to do is to hire someone to work with me. I am a technical founder and I like to do technical stuff. I would like to hire someone to take care of all the business side.

For the company, I aim to model what FarmBot[1] is doing. It's a company that your organisation supported in 2014. I want to spend some time developping the product, then launch a crowdfunding campaign. It is usefull for gaining visibility, sales and financing in order to manufacture. Like them, I aim to provide open-source hardware and software and sell kits to assemble.

I have the ambition of growing the company. I would like to pursue further funding and hire employees. This way we develop the product quicker and we profit more from being first to market. Some companies in the same area are huge and have a lot of ressources to compete. For example, Samsung is spending a lot in research and development in it's smart kitchen. Being first to market gives me a competitive edge, but I have to be big enough then.

## 5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

The kitchen robotics space is very new and as such, the market is not well validated. I did a survey and got positive results, but I am still worried that the market is too small. I am uncertain that people will actually be ready to buy it at the price I am able to sell it.

So, one challenge will be to actually sell my product. The product is similar to smart fridges. The first smart fridges did not sell well because consumers thought it was overpriced for the benefit. It took time to develop a cheaper product that finaly users were interested in buying.

One major concern of mine is safety. A key feature of the machine would be it's independence. It would be awesome if the robot could start cooking by itself when you are at work, then you come home and finish cooking what it started. But in order for the machine to work without supervision, the technology must be well advanced.

There are plenty of technical challenges. I did a proof of concept about most aspects already and I can make it work sometimes. But the challenge is to make it work all the time. For example, with little work, I was able to detect jars most of the time, but this is not enough. It needs to be able to detect jars 100% of the time. Otherwise the robotic arm will probably break it if it does not know it is there.

Another challenge is to finish the product before running out of capital. It takes a lot of time to build a robot. My competitor Moley Robotics started in 2014[1] and have barely a product yet. But I am aiming at a lower end robot so I should be able to complete one in much less time.

## 6) What part does openness play in your idea?

Openness is really important for me because it resonates with two of my core values: freedom and transparency. It takes place in many aspects of my idea. My project will be open-source and open-hardware and the company will be open.

My whole life, I've been using open software almost exclusively. I am using Linux, Firefox, Godot, Freecad, LibreOffice, Bootstrap, Ruby on rails, Gimp, Blender, OpenShot, Krita and so much more. So the least I can do is contribute back and make my software open source. Users will be able to tweak and play with the robotic arm. They will be able to modify the application to customize it to their liking.

I am wondering whether I want to release my project under GPL or MIT license. GPL reassures me by feeling more secure about preventing my idea from being stollen, but I am not the biggest fan of the license. The theory and the idea is good, but in practice I don't like it because it does not give full freedom. When I look at some code on the internet, I love it when it is released under MIT license.

Before working on my project, I was working as an electromechanic. So I am used to repair all sorts of things and I understand how frustrating it is when you can't find schematics or spare parts for something you bought. I want my project to not only be open-source, but to be open-hardware. I want to make schematics and part lists available so people will always be able to repair their machine.

I not only want the product to be open, I want the company to be open too.

I learnt about your grant through FarmBot on their series A article[1]. I though it was really cool of them to be open about the way the company evolved and their status. They even shared sales, capitalization and their business plan. I would like to do the same.

I believe openness is important in order to have control. Personally, I don't want to buy a smart TV unless it would be open. I hate the fact that you don't have control of something you own and bought in your own house.
